PV_fisher
A short code to forecast errors on the normalised growth rate of structure for separate (partially overlapping) redshift and peculiar velocity surveys. Also works for just one of these, so can be used to forecast your favourite LSS survey.
This code is just a python version copy of the C code of C.Howlett (https://github.com/cullanhowlett/PV_fisher), Cite that work.
